This repository shows models created in my paper.
`make_model_and_metrics.py` make model1, model2, model3, and evaluate model1, model2, model3, and base model(RAscore).

To run this, you have to install rdkit via Anaconda, clone RAscore repository, and refact `RAscore_path` in `make_model_and_metrics.py`.
